Basic - Print all the numbers/integers from 0 to 150.

count = 0
while count <= 150: 
    print(count)
    count= count + 1

Multiples of Five - Print all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000,000.

count= 5
while count <= 1000000
    if count % 5 == 5
    print(count)
    count = count + 1

Counting, the Dojo Way - Print integers 1 to 100.  If divisible by 5, print "Coding" instead. If by 10, also print " Dojo".
