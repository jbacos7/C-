                         # localhost:5000/ we will run the following "hello_world" function.
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello World!'  # Return the string 'Hello World!' as a response.
  # If __name__ is "__main__" we know we are running this file directly and not importing

# Create a server file that generates 5 different http responses for the following 5 url requests:

# localhost:5000 - have it say "Hello World!" - Hint: If you have only one route that your server is listening for, it must be your root route ("/")
# localhost:5000/dojo - have it say "Dojo!"
# localhost:5000/say/flask - have it say "Hi Flask".  Have function say() handle this routing request.
# localhost:5000/say/michael - have it say "Hi Michael" (have the same function say() handle this routing request)
# localhost:5000/say/john - have it say "Hi John!" (have the same function say() handle this routing request)
# localhost:5000/repeat/35/hello - have it say "hello" 35 times! - You will need to convert a string "35" to an integer 35.  To do this use int().  For example int("35") returns 35.  If the user request localhost:5000/repeat/80/hello, it should say "hello" 80 times.
# localhost:5000/repeat/99/dogs - have it say "dogs" 99 times! (have this be handled by the same route function as #6)
# We hope you feel comfortable with routes now.
