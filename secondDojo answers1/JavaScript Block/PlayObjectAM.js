Practice iterating through an array of objects and dictionaries. Imagine that you
are given an array of objects. 



var users = [{name: "Michael", age:37}, {name: "John", age:30}, {name:
"David", age:27}];


How would you print/log Johns age? How would you print/log the name of the 
first object? How would you print/log the name and age of each user using a
for loop?  


var users = [{name: "Michael", age:37}, {name: "John", age:30}, {name:
"David", age:27}];

var users = {};
users= {
	name: Michael, John, David,
	age: 37, 30, 27
}

{ 
	var : users,
	name: "John",
	age: 30,
}
